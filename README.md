# Asteroid-inspired-game

To run this you will need Ubuntu(16.18 and 19 version prefered).
after downloading the folder, open terminal in that folder and run the following command. 

chmod +x install-libraries.sh

./install-libraries.sh

make all

./game
 

Arrow keys are for movement

upper and lower arrow keys act as acceleration and deacceleration keys respectively for the bomber man
right and left keys are used to change/rotate the direction of the bomber man

"b" key is used to fire bullets at the enemy

Bamber man has 3 lives he loses  1 life after either colliding with another object or my enemy fire
after you lose all lives it's game over 

game is not finished. following things are missing at the moment
finishing touches like show live bar lives, showing game over on the screen when the bomber man dies and your current score

levelling system ideally after defeating all enemies game should progress to the next level with   tougher enemies but as of this moment its is not implemented in this build
